= Changelog

== 9.0.0-rc.4

=== Features

- add paramater decorators for `State`, `Context` and `Observe`
- refactor effect types to support additional use cases

[source, typescript]
----
class AppEffects {
    @Effect()
    incrementCount(@Context() context: Context<AppState>) {}
}
----

=== Misc

- remove `latestFrom` and roll it into `changes`
- use proxy in prod if supported

== 9.0.0-rc.3

- export missing tokens and tweak defaults

The default value of `markDirty` will now be `true` if the effect configures a `bind` or `assign` option. This is a better default in most cases, and can be configured by setting `@Effect("prop", { markDirty: false })`.

== 9.0.0-rc.2

=== Features

- expose experimental connect API

== 9.0.0-rc.1

=== Features

- add experimental global `connect` function
- add host observer as third argument to effect methods

=== Misc

- return cached metadata for already seen effect tokens
- create effects in effect runner instead of explorer
- create adapter in effect runner instead of explorer
- make `markDirty` calls synchronous unless in noop zone
- reduce usage of rxjs operators
- updated docs

=== BREAKING CHANGES

- remove `createEffect` factory
- rename `EffectHandler` to `EffectAdapter`
- `EffectAdapter` arguments are now just `value` and `metadata`. Options are now accessed through `metadata.options`
